// solution to Silicon West Max Character problem

const MaxCharacter = string => {
  let splitString = string.split("")
  maxCharacter = null
  // iterate over each character in the split string
  sortedString = splitString.sort()

  // count how many times character appears in the string

  // if count is higher, mark that character as highest

  // return character with highest count
  return sortedString
}
